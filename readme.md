# Dynamic Tic Tac Toe App Challenge

Create a web app that will allow a user to input size of Tic Tac Toe Board and calculate the winner.

## MVP
* Enter names into an input, and click a button to add them to the list.  The button should also clear the input to be ready for more names.
* The input should accept either single names, or multiple comma-separated names.
* Have a way to select one random student from the ones that have been entered.  It will somehow display the randomly selected student on the page.
* This may be styled and organized however you like, but try to focus on clarity and usability.
## Extra Features:
* Implement a feature that will group the students into teams.  Have a number input which will determine the team size.  The teams will be selected randomly, and then displayed on the DOM.  If there aren't enough students to fill all teams evenly, put the remainders in their own team.
* Make it look good!

With all of these features, make sure that you can repeat the actions without weird results. (for instance, every time you press the "one random student" button, it should only display one student total.  The previous student should go away.)

## MVP:
* Use jQuery.
* Two players may play TTT on one computer. The players take turns clicking squares to make their moves.
* The game should indicate who's turn it is.
* Win detection: When a player has made three-in-a-row, your app declare the winner and the game will be over.
* Have a way to start the game over.
* Deploy to gh-pages, and submit to the Google Form.
## Extra Features:
* Allow users to input their names.
* You may allow players to select who plays first, or you may like to make that random.
* Include animations.
* Allow the option to have a bigger board. 4x4! 5x5!
